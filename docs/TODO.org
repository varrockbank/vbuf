* Unhandled bugs

- At last character of last last line. Behaviors such as move next row, move next col should add new line to buffer

* Rendering improvements

- When on the last position of the last line of a selection, render the cursor position with a different color. Vim uses one color for the selection and a special color for the actual cursor.

* TODO Horizontal scroll when cursor moves offscreen
Currently the viewport does not scroll horizontally when the cursor moves to a column that is outside the visible area. The cursor can move beyond the visible width but the view doesn't follow.

* TODO Make width/height configuration more consistent
Currently width is set via CSS on the container, while height is set via the `initialViewportSize` constructor option. Consider making these more consistent (both CSS, or both API).

* TODO Fix width sizing gotchas
When users specify `width: 40ch`, they expect 40 characters of usable text area. Currently they get ~35 (with gutter) or ~38 (without gutter) because the width includes gutter, padding, and border.

Additional caveat: `ch` units are based on the container's font-size, but vbuf sets `font-size: lineHeight` (default 24px) on `.wb-lines`. If the container has a different font-size, `ch` measurements won't match actual character widths.

Possible solutions:
- Add a `columns` constructor option that sets width on `.wb-lines` directly
- Auto-calculate container width based on desired columns + gutter + padding
- Use `box-sizing: content-box` on `.wb-lines` and set width there
- Document the exact overhead so users can calculate (gutter ~5ch, padding ~1.5ch)
- Set font-size on container to match lineHeight automatically

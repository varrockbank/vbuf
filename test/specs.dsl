### Redo restores cursor to position after edit (coalesced)
TYPE "AB"
fixture.wb.History.undo();
EXPECT cursor at 0,0
fixture.wb.History.redo();
EXPECT cursor at 0,2

## should restore cursor and selection on undo delete selection
### Regression: Undo delete selection restores cursor to original selection start

expect(fixture).toHaveLines(" World");
EXPECT cursor at 0,0
fixture.wb.History.undo();

EXPECT cursor at 0,1
fixture.wb.History.undo();

# Selection rendering

## should show cursor on empty line
### Regression: Cursor visible on empty line via .wb-cursor
// Empty editor, cursor at 0,0 should render via .wb-cursor (selection width=0)
const $cursor = fixture.node.querySelector(".wb-cursor");
expect($cursor.style.visibility).toBe("visible");

## should show cursor after typing
### Regression: Cursor visible after typing text via .wb-cursor
TYPE "Hello"
const $cursor = fixture.node.querySelector(".wb-cursor");
expect($cursor.style.visibility).toBe("visible");

## should not show phantom newline when no newline exists
### Regression: Single line with no newline shows selection excluding cursor
TYPE "Hello"
left with meta
right 5 times with shift
// Selection from col 0 to col 5 on "Hello" (len 5), no second line
// Should show 5ch (selection excludes cursor head position)
const $sel = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[0];
expect($sel.style.width).toBe("5ch");

## should show selection excluding cursor when selecting forward to EOL with newline
### Regression: Forward selection to EOL excludes cursor head position
TYPE "Hello"
enter
TYPE "World"
up
left with meta
right 5 times with shift
// Selection from col 0 to col 5 on "Hello" (len 5), with newline after
// Selection excludes cursor head, shows 5ch
const $sel = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[0];
expect($sel.style.width).toBe("5ch");

## should not show phantom newline when selecting backward from EOL (no newline)
### Regression: Backward selection from EOL excludes phantom (single line)
TYPE "Hello"
left with shift
// Selection from col 4 to col 5, but selecting LEFT from col 5
// Backward selection should show 1ch (just "o", no phantom)
const $sel = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[0];
expect($sel.style.width).toBe("1ch");

## should not show phantom newline when selecting backward from EOL (with newline)
### Regression: Backward selection from EOL excludes phantom even when newline exists
TYPE "Hello"
enter
TYPE "World"
up
right with meta
left with shift
// On first line "Hello" with newline, select backward from col 5 to col 4
// Backward selection should show 1ch (just "o", not the newline)
const $sel = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[0];
expect($sel.style.width).toBe("1ch");

## should show phantom newline on first line of multi-line selection
### Regression: Multi-line selection first line includes phantom newline
TYPE "Hello"
enter
TYPE "World"
up
left with meta
down with shift
// First line "Hello" from col 0 should show 6ch (5 chars + phantom)
const $sel0 = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[0];
expect($sel0.style.width).toBe("6ch");

## should show phantom newline on middle lines of multi-line selection
### Regression: Multi-line selection middle lines include phantom newline
TYPE "First"
enter
TYPE "Middle"
enter
TYPE "Last"
up 2 times
left with meta
down 2 times with shift
// Middle line "Middle" (row 1) should show 7ch (6 chars + phantom)
const $sel1 = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[1];
expect($sel1.style.width).toBe("7ch");

## should select newline before wrapping to next line
### Regression: Selecting right at EOL selects newline first, then wraps
TYPE "Hello"
enter
TYPE "a"
up
left with meta
// Select "Hell" (4 chars): 4 shift+rights from col 0 to col 4
right 4 times with shift
EXPECT selection at 0,0-0,4

right with shift
EXPECT selection at 0,0-0,5
const $sel5 = fixture.node.querySelectorAll(".wb-selection")[0];
expect($sel5.style.width).toBe("5ch");
// Select one more to wrap to next line (row 1, col 0)
right with shift
EXPECT selection at 0,0-1,0
// Select one more to include "a"
right with shift
EXPECT selection at 0,0-1,1

## should show last line of multi-line selection excluding cursor
### Regression: Multi-line selection last line excludes cursor head position
TYPE "a"
enter
TYPE "b"
enter
TYPE "c"
up 2 times
right with meta
// Cursor at col 1 row 0 (phantom position of "a")
// Select right: wrap to row 1 col 0

expect($r1b.style.width).toBe("1ch");
// Select right again: wrap to row 2
right with shift
EXPECT selection at 0,1-2,0

## should delete text and newline when selection includes phantom
### Regression: Deleting selection that includes phantom newline joins lines
TYPE "a"
enter
TYPE "b"
up
left with meta
// Select "a" + phantom newline (col 0 to col 1)
right with shift
EXPECT selection at 0,0-0,1
// Delete should remove "a" and the newline, leaving just "b" on line 0

# Unindent

## should only unindent actual leading spaces on middle lines
### Bug: unindent checks charAt(0) instead of charAt(k) for middle lines
// Bug only triggers on middle lines of multi-line selection
// (not first/last)
// Middle line "  x" has 2 leading spaces, indentation=4
// Bug: charAt(0) always ' ', counts all 3 chars as unindentable
//      → "  x".slice(3) = ""
// Fix: charAt(k) checks each position → only 2 spaces
//      → "  x".slice(2) = "x"
